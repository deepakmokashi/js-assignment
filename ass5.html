 <!-- we learn difference between var and let Keywords -->
<!-- var keyword -->
<script>
var m;
m=7;
document.write("Value of m using var", m);

<!-- In the above snippet code we declaress m and print its value -->
<script>
{
    let m;
    m=9;
    document.write("value of m using let in block",m); 
}
</script>

<script>
document.write("value after block",m);
</script>


<!-- But In the above code snippet we declares m and print in cearly braces ,so It will print new value. 
    and outside the scope we print so it will print previous value. as we can see in the output below  -->
  
    <!-- Value of m using var7
         value of m using let in block9
         value after block7 
    -->
  
    <!-- But it is not the case with var it will print
         Value of m using var 7
         value of m using let in block 9
         value after block 9

        <!-- This is main Difference  -->
        <!-- And var is used for global scope and let is used for functional block -->

        <b>Above output using var for global scope and let used for functional block</b>
         
        <h2>This is main Difference</h2>
        <h2>And var is used for global scope and let is used for functional block</h2>
        <h2>var is used in previous version Es6 used let Keyword </h2>
